The HTTPHelper is a class written in Microsoft .NET that provides a very easy to use API to make HTTP-related calls all without knowing how any of it all works.
You can add cookies, custom HTTP headers, GET and POST data, and even download files and inject your own plugins into the code class instance to provide for real-time file download status updates.

Oh, and it's open source too!
